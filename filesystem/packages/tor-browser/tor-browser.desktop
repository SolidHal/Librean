# the tor browser bundle cannot run from anywhere owned by root, as it needs to modify its files at runtime
# to get around this problem, this file makes a copy of the tor browser bundle and puts it in the users ~/.local/share if it does not already exist
# it then launches the browser
# if the user already has the browser bundle, it just launches the browser
